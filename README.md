# Bengali Handwritten Character Recognition

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the recognition of handwritten Bengali characters. The ability to accurately identify handwritten characters is crucial for various applications, including optical character recognition (OCR), language processing, and document digitization. With the rise of digital platforms and the increasing need for automated systems, efficient character recognition algorithms play a significant role in bridging the gap between handwritten content and digital processing.

### Description
The Bengali Handwritten Character Recognition project employs Python programming language along with deep learning libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow to build and train a CNN model. The model is trained on the CMATERdb dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset for Bengali handwritten character recognition tasks.

### Key Features
- Utilizes Convolutional Neural Network architecture for feature extraction and classification.
- Implemented in Python for flexibility, ease of use, and extensive libraries support.
- Leveraged Keras, a high-level neural networks API, for building and training the model.
- Employs TensorFlow as the backend for efficient computation and optimization.
- Achieves an impressive accuracy of 96.37% on the CMATERdb Dataset, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of the developed model.

## Dataset
CMATERdb is a benchmark dataset for Bengali handwritten character recognition. It contains diverse handwritten characters for training and evaluation. The dataset is split into:
- Training Set (10800 images): Used to train the model.
- Validation Set (1200 images): Used for hyperparameter tuning and performance monitoring.
- Test Set (3000 images): Used to evaluate the final model performance.
